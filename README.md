## Contributing

VuLib follows the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model. The `master` branch always reflects a production-ready state while the latest development is taking place in the `develop` branch.

Each time you want to work on a fix or a new feature, create a new branch based on the `develop` branch: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME develop`. Only pull requests to the `develop` branch will be merged.
